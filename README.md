# Project Description
The website serves as a productivity hub for people who want to organize their tasks and work they have to do. It’ll sync with a list of completed tasks and a calendar. The user will be able to see the small level of work they need to do, as well as the large scale level of work to do on the calendar.

## Time Splt on Tasks
### Proposal
-Exact 50-50 split (each person did 2 bullet points)

### Weekend 6-3 → 6-5
-Tahseen did a majority of the work here, creating the HTML and CSS framework. All the pages were created and the form + task list were done by Monday. 
<br />
-Adam worked on creating newTask.py. Wanting to wait for a functioning form system, he didn’t test it yet.

### 6/6/16
Backend finally met frontend, both Tahseen and Adam spent a lot of time perfecting things. They met at whole foods after school to make communicating easier. Having now received the front end, Adam did a bit more work in terms of modifying and creating new python codes to create and delete codes, however Tahseen still worked on making sure the pages looked good on every computer screen (no matter the size).

### 6/8/16
Tahseen developed the front end of the login and signup forms. 

### 6/10/16
Login backend files were finally connected with the frontend forms. Great thanks to Ms. Genkina for providing backend files.

### 6/10/16
Final login errors were corrected. Adam made final backend touch ups. Tahseen made final frontend touch ups. The calendar goal was abandoned.

## People
_Who helped you? What did they contribute?_

### Ms. Genkina:
-Gave us the lovely code to return a dictionary with the query values (our getQuery function)
<br />
-Gave us the even lovelier login/signup code that was integrated into our site Log In/Sign Up pages. Confirm password and logout features we didn’t previously have - woo!

### Sophia Gunluk: 
-Thank you Sophia Gunluk (Mr. K’s PD 2 Intro 2 Class) for explaining how to make user specific web pages, by passing along the user query and storing the data along with the users+passwords.

### Stack Overflow:
-Taught us JSON, so that we could move list data around between files

## Programming & Ideas
_What ideas or code in your project originated somewhere other than the heads of the partners? Provide links to any sources that are publicly available._

### Google Keep:
-Tahseen uses Google Keep on a daily basis, but sometimes it gets too complex and annoying.

-keep.google.com

### Producteev:
-Tahseen used Producteev for three weeks. It was way too complex, slow and annoying. This is definitely an improvement on Producteev.

# Desirable features, with time estimates

## In Priority Order [BACK-END]:
-Working checklist (sub priorities are important too)
<br />
-Add new task
<br />
-Check off
<br />
-Saves
<br />
-Completed Tasks
<br />
-Showcase completed tasks 
<br />
-Get Log in working (see: learn how to do log ins ._.)
<br />
##### LONG TERM POSSIBLY NOT ACHIEVABLE GOALS:
-A calendar, to view and manage your tasks
-Make dealing with your tasks interactive, put all of them on ducks and have them move around?

## In Priority Order [FRONT-END]:
-Build a 12 Column Fluid Grid System 
-Figure out color scheme, fonts, etc
-Build a CSS files solely for design
-Build each HTML file and structure for each page!

# Achievements
_Which of your aims did you accomplish?
<br />
Help the grader see significant features of your project. Do the math: in a 35-hour week I could spend 20 minutes on each of 100 projects. Between reading documentation, reviewing code, assigning points according to a rubric, and recording comments, I may have 5–7 minutes to spend running your project. Unless you tell me where to look, I am unlikely to notice the cool parts. So please tell me where to look._

-12 Column Fluid Grid System, great! -Tahseen
-Login System
-Individualized Task Lists
-Delete Tasks

# Next Steps, with time estimates
_Did you just create a dummy version of a function that will be completed later? List it here.
<br />
Did you find a bug whose repair can be postponed, so you maintain your focus on the current task? List it here.
<br />
Ace programmer Gene Lewin taught me the value of a list like this, which grows and shrinks during programming. Ideally, it shrinks to a null list and the project is considered done._

### As of 6/12 - For the future
-Possibly a Calendar
-Potential Text Message reminders
-Potential Email reminders
